----------------
To build an AI-powered trading algorithm for crypto price prediction and risk assessment, we will go through the following steps:

    Data Collection: We will gather historical market data for cryptocurrency prices and other indicators.
    Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data to be used for training machine learning models.
    Model Development: We will develop machine learning models for price prediction and risk assessment.
    Backtesting: Evaluate the performance of the trading strategy using historical data.
    Trading Algorithm: Implement an automated trading strategy that works based on the insights generated by the AI models.
    Deployment: We will optimize the model for high-frequency trading (HFT) in the Pakistan crypto market, considering specific market conditions.

1. Install Required Libraries

First, we need to install some required libraries:

    pandas, numpy for data manipulation.
    sklearn for machine learning models.
    tensorflow for deep learning models.
    ccxt for connecting to cryptocurrency exchanges (to fetch live data).

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow ccxt matplotlib

2. Data Collection (Using ccxt Library)

We'll use the ccxt library to fetch historical crypto price data from exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, etc.

import ccxt
import pandas as pd

# Initialize exchange (example: Binance)
exchange = ccxt.binance()

# Function to fetch historical data
def fetch_historical_data(symbol, timeframe='1h', limit=1000):
    ohlcv = exchange.fetch_ohlcv(symbol, timeframe=timeframe, limit=limit)
    data = pd.DataFrame(ohlcv, columns=['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'])
    data['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(data['timestamp'], unit='ms')
    return data

# Fetch data for Bitcoin
symbol = 'BTC/USDT'  # You can change this to any other crypto pair
data = fetch_historical_data(symbol)
print(data.head())

3. Data Preprocessing

Now we will preprocess the data by adding technical indicators, which can be used as features for the machine learning models.

import ta  # Technical analysis library

# Function to add technical indicators
def add_technical_indicators(data):
    data['SMA_50'] = data['close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
    data['SMA_200'] = data['close'].rolling(window=200).mean()
    data['RSI'] = ta.momentum.RSIIndicator(data['close']).rsi()
    data['MACD'] = ta.trend.MACD(data['close']).macd()
    data['ATR'] = ta.volatility.AverageTrueRange(data['high'], data['low'], data['close']).average_true_range()
    data.dropna(inplace=True)
    return data

# Add technical indicators
data = add_technical_indicators(data)
print(data.tail())

4. Model Development (AI Models)

We will use machine learning models to predict crypto price movements. A simple starting point is using a Random Forest Regressor for price prediction and Logistic Regression for risk assessment (classification: Buy/Sell).

Here’s how to train a predictive model for price prediction:

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Prepare features and target
features = ['SMA_50', 'SMA_200', 'RSI', 'MACD', 'ATR']
target = 'close'

# X = Features, y = Target
X = data[features]
y = data[target]

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, shuffle=False)

# Initialize the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on test set
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate error
error = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Mean Absolute Error: {error}')

For risk assessment, we can create a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression) to predict whether a crypto asset should be bought or sold based on certain risk indicators.

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Create a 'Buy' (1) / 'Sell' (0) target for risk assessment
data['target'] = (data['close'].shift(-1) > data['close']).astype(int)

# X = Features, y = Target for classification
X = data[features]
y = data['target']

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, shuffle=False)

# Initialize the classifier
classifier = LogisticRegression()

# Train the model
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on test set
classification_predictions = classifier.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = (classification_predictions == y_test).mean()
print(f'Classification Accuracy: {accuracy}')

5. Backtesting (Evaluate Trading Strategy)

You should backtest your trading strategy using historical data to see how well your AI model performs in different market conditions.

def backtest_strategy(data, model, classifier):
    balance = 1000  # Initial balance in USD
    position = 0  # Amount of crypto held (initially 0)
    
    for i in range(len(data)-1):
        # Get the current price and decision to Buy/Sell
        current_price = data['close'].iloc[i]
        prediction = model.predict([data.iloc[i][features]])  # Price prediction
        risk_decision = classifier.predict([data.iloc[i][features]])  # Buy (1) or Sell (0)
        
        # Trading logic
        if risk_decision == 1 and balance > current_price:  # Buy signal
            position = balance / current_price
            balance = 0
            print(f"Buying at {current_price} USD")
        elif risk_decision == 0 and position > 0:  # Sell signal
            balance = position * current_price
            position = 0
            print(f"Selling at {current_price} USD")

    # Final balance after the last trade
    if position > 0:
        balance = position * data['close'].iloc[-1]

    return balance

# Backtest the strategy
final_balance = backtest_strategy(data, model, classifier)
print(f'Final Balance: {final_balance}')

6. Real-Time Trading (Automated Execution)

To implement real-time trading, you need to integrate your model with a live trading API (like Binance, Coinbase, or others). You will use the trading signals generated by your model to execute buy/sell orders.

For example, with ccxt, you can place orders on Binance as follows:

def place_order(symbol, order_type, amount, price=None):
    if order_type == 'buy':
        exchange.create_market_buy_order(symbol, amount)
    elif order_type == 'sell':
        exchange.create_market_sell_order(symbol, amount)

# Example usage: Buying 0.01 BTC
place_order('BTC/USDT', 'buy', 0.01)

Make sure to use your own exchange API key and handle API rate limits carefully.
7. Optimization for High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

For high-frequency trading (HFT), the algorithm should be optimized for speed and low latency:

    Use limit orders instead of market orders to minimize slippage.
    Implement multi-threading or asynchronous programming to make sure the bot is processing in real-time.
    Use WebSocket API for receiving real-time price feeds from exchanges.

8. Risk Management

Implement risk management strategies like:

    Stop-loss orders: Set thresholds where the bot automatically sells if the price drops by a certain percentage.
    Position sizing: Adjust the amount to invest based on risk assessment (e.g., invest a fixed percentage of the total balance).
    Diversification: Avoid investing too heavily in one asset.

Conclusion

This system provides the basic building blocks for an AI-powered crypto trading algorithm. You can expand it by:

    Using more sophisticated models (e.g., LSTMs, reinforcement learning for optimal strategy development).
    Implementing more advanced risk management strategies.
    Continuously optimizing and refining models as the market evolves.

Be mindful of the limitations and challenges of crypto trading, such as market volatility, liquidity, and the legal regulations in different regions, especially in Pakistan.
